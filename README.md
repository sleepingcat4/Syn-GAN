# Synthetic-Data-Generator---GAN
A simple approach to generate Syntheic Data using GAN


# GAN
GAN is class of machine learning framework, where the neural networks contest with each other in ag game.

# What's Conditional GAN
CGAN is a type of GAN that also takes advantage of labels during the training process. Generator - Given a label and random array as input, this network generates data with the same structure as the training data
obeservations corresponding to the same label. Here label y is added as an additional parameter to the generator and hopes that the corresponding images are generated.

# What's Synthetic Data?
A Type of data or datasets that are generated artificially rather than by real-world events.

## Why this project?
It is a good project to understand the underlying structure of GAN and complex concepts of Artificial Intelligence. Afterwards, datasets are in high demand in AI and Data Science. 
GAN could enable a solution to this problem through generating high-quality data using noise and other parameters. Through this project I tried to understand what methods of AI can be used to generate Synthetic data.

Though CGAN or GAN is not a totality of a solution but data generated from this architecture be used to train or test model with a certain level of good precision.

## Note: I have added the Jupyter Notebook. Feel free to check to the notebook. Several parts of the code concepts are taken from research papers and high-end AI books. Because it's still a novel topic.
